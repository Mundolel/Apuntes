# Related problems to software development
* Requirements are in constant change
* Frequent changes are difficult to manage
* There are many software systems

Software process:
Activities -> 

Software life cycle:
1. Conception
Pre-development
2. Childhood (unstable)
Development
3. Adulthood (stable)
Post-development
4. Postmortem
We go back to conception

Where do we apply the software development life cycle?
1. Games
2. Data
3. BPMs

Speaking about software cycle doesn't implies a recipee, rather a work philosophy, a framework.

We usually have 3 options for software creation:
1. Create from scratch
2. Reutilize smth that's already in operation
3. Extend existing systems

Cascade model: as known, C, Basic and other languages
V model: it requires more time but assures certainty over the process of development
Sawtooth: There is a problem with isolation over the development of the modules but also there is too much power over the client towards the development. 
The client needs to have technical capacities to understand the factors of the proyect.
Sharktooth: The same of sawtooth but with an additional layer of administrative checking. Despite having solved the technical knowledge needed by the client, still has a great isolated part in the developing of the proyect.
Evolutive development: differ between neccesary requirements and unnecessary requirements.
development based on components: Reutilization, components repositories like those commercials and developed in previous proyects.
Iterative development.
Spiral development
Ratuonal unified process: This was a business before, was created by the guys of UML
